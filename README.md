This is a gui added to one of my homework assignments for bioinf529.
I'm not super happy with how the animation plays in the gui but it also saves the resulting animation as "gol.gif"
I would like to revisit this project once I better understand how PySimpleGUI works so I can get it to output better

This project is based off of agent-based modeling.
